## The prompts for obtaining catergorization of description sentences
We employed ChatGPT-o3, a powerful OpenAI large model for reasoning, to analyze the distribution of described places, artifacts, and extents. 
After careful prompting, checking, and re-prompting, we ended up with 14 categories of places, 19 categories of artifacts, and 4 categories of extents, 
and their ratios to the total number of descriptions in the dataset are obtained.   
The prompts we used are shown [here](./Prompts_categorization.md).
